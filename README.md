# Emily Hudson Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a NCAA Women's Volleyball Boxscore Dataset. There are 26 different attributes ranging from hitting percentage, number of aces, sets played and several others. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylerwiddison/ncaa-womens-volleyball-boxscores-20122019?resource=download&select=ncaa_w_boxscores_2012-2019.csv


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Do players who start games actually have higher statistics than players who do not start or their team overall? 
 * Is there a relationship between the starting lineups performance and outcome of the game? 
 * Do players at certain schools improve their stats over time more dramatically than players at other schools?

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
