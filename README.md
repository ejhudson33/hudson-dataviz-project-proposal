# Emily Hudson Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a NCAA Women's Volleyball Boxscore Dataset. There are 26 different attributes ranging from hitting percentage, number of aces, sets played and several others. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylerwiddison/ncaa-womens-volleyball-boxscores-20122019?resource=download&select=ncaa_w_boxscores_2012-2019.csv


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Is there a relationsip between final standings and hitting percentage or digs per a game? 
 * Is there a relationship between the starting lineups performance and outcome of the game? 
 * Do players at certain schools improve their stats over time more dramatically than players at other schools?

## Sketches

This sketch shows a visualization that compares hitting percentages across schools for multiple years. This visualization can be altered to show more than two years worth of data to help answer the question regarding other schools improving their player's performance more efficiently than others.

Another sketch that I created that is more dynamic and shows a second attribute of the data is attached below. It is a chart that has circles that represent each Big Ten school. The circles would start showing the average of each teams average digs per a game (X-axis) and average hitting percentage (Y-Axis) for 2012. The chart would dynamically change to show this data for each year until 2019.

Another version of this chart could show the average change in their players hitting percentage or digs per a game. This chart would only take in consideration players who have been on the team for at least 2 years. It would average the difference between each player's most recent hitting percentage and the previous year.This would indicate whether players, on average, show an improvement or decline in hitting.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a scatterplot and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
